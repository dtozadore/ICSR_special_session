## 📝 Description
Speculative and creative methods in HRI aim to create novel Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) designs, provoke thought and imagine possible near and far futures, and critique the values, norms and socio-technical implications embedded into robotic designs. We invite authors to submit full papers utilising speculative and creative methods exploring the questions:

- What kind of desirable and undesirable human-robot interaction futures might we imagine through speculative and creative methods?
- How can we use speculative and creative methods to challenge assumptions in HRI?
- What kind of socio-technical and ethical discussions around HRI can be provoked using speculative and creative methods?

In this special session, we invite researchers and artists to submit full papers that imagine creative and speculative “what-if” futures of human-robot interaction, challenge assumptions of HRI, and provoke discussion about desirable and undesirable human-robot futures. 

We are motivated by the fact that speculative and creative approaches are currently underutilised in HRI research. We believe that these approaches can enable critical conversations about where the HRI field is headed, having a positive impact on its future. With this special session, we aim to create a space where participants across disciplines can learn from each other about how speculative and creative approaches can be usefully applied in HRI. We welcome submissions that explore speculative and creative human-robot interaction, as well as empirical, technical, theoretical and artistic contributions with elements of speculation and creativity.

## 📚 List of topics (*but not limited to)
- **Speculative and Critical Design in HRI**: Works incorporating speculative and critical design methods in HRI, including design fiction, design probes, aesthetic and narrative prototyping, aesthetic analysis, futures exploration and analysis, artefact generation and analysis, participatory speculation, critical speculation, etc.
- **Creative Methods in HRI**: Works incorporating creative practice and arts adjacent methods in HRI, including performances, artefacts, painting and sketching, storyboarding and comics, theatre and music, comedy, participatory creative, critical creativity, storytelling and narratives, prototyping robotic characters and personalities, etc.
- **Artistic contributions for HRI**: Such as performances, robotic artefacts, narratives, immersive arts, games and installations. We expect that these submissions are framed as an academic contribution, including detailed methodology, critical analysis and positioning of the contribution in relation to relevant HRI literature, and identifying insights and implications for the HRI community.
- **Methodological advances in speculative, creative or artistic HRI**: Works advancing and documenting the use of speculative and creative methods as applied in or for the development of the HRI field. 
**Empirical, technical, and theoretical contributions with a significant speculative, creative or artistic element.**
- **Aesthetics of human-robot interactions**: Exploring the impact and implications of robot and human-robot interaction aesthetics, e.g. creepy or cute robots.
- **Utopian and dystopian human-robot futures**: Speculative and anticipatory work exploring socio-technical configurations of human-robot futures, ethical and critical analysis of speculative futures, political and sociological perspectives in human-robot futures
- **Human-robot imaginaries**: Analysing and critiquing existing imaginaries of human-robot interactions across arts, industry and research
- **Human-robot relationality**: Creative approaches and speculations on configurations of human-robot relationality, ethical and cultural implications, labour and class in human-robot relations

## 👥 Envisioned Participants
We invite participants that span across both HRI research and creative practice communities. Participants will both creatively explore future human–robot relationships using speculative methods, and critically interrogate them. We therefore welcome researchers and critical scholars, but also designers, technologists, and artists who are actively engaging with or particularly interested in speculative, design-led, creative methodologies.
